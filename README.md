In this project, I examine the sentiments of Game of Thrones fans as they watch the 8th season, using VADER sentiment analysis tool and pyLDAviz.

The data for this analysis came from three Game of Thrones and a Song of Ice and Fire fan subreddits (r/gameofthrones, r/freefolk, and r/asoiaf) and the Song of Ice and Fire forum. Collected for the period from April 1st through May 20th.
